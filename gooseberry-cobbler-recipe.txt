Ingredients:

  -750g gooseberries, washed, topped and tailed
  -100g caster sugar
  -1 tsp grated root ginger
  -3 tbsp elderflower cordial

 For the topping
  -140g plain flour
  -2 tsp baking powder
  -25g butter
  -25g caster sugar
  -150ml buttermilk
  -1 tbsp demerara sugar

Directions:

  1. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Place the gooseberries, caster sugar, ginger and elderflower in a saucepan with 4 tbsp water and cook, covered, for 5 mins until the berries begin to pop. Tip into a baking dish.
  2. Make the topping. Sift the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl. Rub in the butter until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then stir in the caster sugar. Mix in the buttermilk to give a soft, sticky dough. Dollop spoonfuls on top of the gooseberries, then sprinkle with the demerara. Bake for 25 mins or until golden brown and crusty. Stand for 5 mins, then serve with some low-fat ice cream, fromage frais or custard.
